# go mod example

Just for me to understand.

You _should_ be able to check this project anywhere (e.g outside your $GOPATH) and it'll work 

## steps for a new project

- Make a folder anywhere
- Init go mod with some kind of name e.g `go mod init github.com/quii/go-mod-example`
- Write the codes, IDE support works great!
